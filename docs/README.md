## Important Considerations

**Ethical Use**: news-watch is designed for educational and research purposes. Always respect website terms of service and implement appropriate delays between requests.

**Performance**: Works best in local environments. Cloud platforms like Google Colab may experience reduced performance due to anti-bot measures.

**Development Status**: The Python API is currently in active development. While functional for most use cases, some edge cases in concurrent scraping are still being refined.
